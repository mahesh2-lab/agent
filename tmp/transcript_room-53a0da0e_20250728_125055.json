We're looking to fill a Full Stack Developer role, and based on your resume, your skills and experience seem like a good fit.\n\nTo start, can you tell me about your experience with the MERN stack, and perhaps describe a specific project where you utilized all four technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js? I'm interested in understanding your role in the project, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.\n"
